# NbFe2-Project
This code is supposed to help with the investigation of the material called NbFe2, a peculiar ferromagnet with emerging spin-density wave order. With neutron spectroscopy,
we can study the magnetic excitations of the system. The objective is to better understand the physics of the system and the nature of magnetic excitations as well as discovering all possible spin configurations of the atoms (which are part of a crystaline structure)
